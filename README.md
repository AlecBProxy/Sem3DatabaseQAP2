# Semester 3 | Database Programming | QAP 2
This is a repo that contains files for my second QAP in Database Programming

# Problem #1 is a simulated University Course Enrollment system
Here, we created a small database and executed some queries, such as updating the email of a student.

# Problem #2 is a simulated Online Store Inventory and Orders System
Here, we created a similar small database, and executed some SQL queries, such as retrieving the names and stock quantities of all products
